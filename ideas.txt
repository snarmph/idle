begin:
  - find wood, stone, seeds
  - plant manually
  - use pinpins to do some slow automatisation
 



end (demo):
  - currency isn't money anymore (land? humans?)
  - pinpins automate most low level things
    - they breed and train automatically
  - maybe game becomes sort of Risk-like strategy game?
    - need solider pinpins
	- maybe have like a tech tree?
  - objective is conquering the island-nation that you live in (sterminating all humans?)

--------------------------------------

TODO

[ ] tooltip in skills should show which resources you have enough of
[ ] exchange wood for wheat? (like 50 to 1)

--------------------------------------

[x] start by manually looking around
[x] build tent
[x] start planting what seeds you find
[x] keep exploring and planting until you find the merchant
[x] sell wheat to the merchant
[x] when you have enough money, buy pinpins and start automating
[x] build house then castle
[ ] unlock a skill tree (for every tab?) (maybe each skill can be upgraded itself)
 -> forest
   -> [ ] merchant can sell explorer pinpins (etc)
   -> [ ] merchant buys 10 wheat at a time (50, 100, etc)
     -> [ ] merchant gives + 2% coins per wheat
	
 -> [ ] castle (unlocked when you have a castle)
   -> [ ] every tile is made of 25 tiles 
     (to automatically do an action on the tile, 25 pinpins need to act on it, etc)
	 (it also takes x25 times to do anything on them, they're effectively 25 tiles in one)
     -> [ ] every tile is made of 625 (etc, etc)
   -> [ ] wheat grows faster (etc)
   -> [ ] wheat has a +5% chance of remaining planted 
     (not having to reuse a seed or preparing the ground)
	 (% remains the same for bigger tiles too (doesn't scale))
   
 -> [ ] pinpins (unlocked when breeding pinpins)
   -> [ ] farmer pinpins can plant carrots (carrots needs to be unlocked) (etc)
   -> [ ] pinpins can train other pinpins to the same profession
   -> [ ] can breed 2 specialised pinpins
     -> [ ] if breeding two specialised pinpins they get (their level) +5% cps (+10%, +15%, etc)
	 -> [ ] pinpins breed automatically
	 -> [ ] pinpins grow faster
	 -> [ ] can build pinpin villages (25 huts)
	   -> [ ] can build pinpin cities (unlock next section of the game?)
	     -> [ ] provinces??

- [ ] learn how to breed pinpins (maybe a pinpin breeder shows up?)
 - [ ] take two pinpins and let them breed (takes n minutes)
 - [ ] needs space (a hut?), build more space, do more breeding
 - [ ] can only breed basic pinpins, which only make basic pinpins



================================

[ ] update every frame!
[ ] pause when you lose focus?
[ ] pinpins don't have random chance, they get stuff per second
[ ] no seller pinpins
[ ] no money resource
[ ] more automatic at the beginning
